bsnes-netplay
=====
**Note: This project is still a work in progress!**

A custom build of the bsnes emulator, integrated with GekkoNet, to provide
robust and low-latency netplay capabilities.

Currently, it supports direct IP connections between two players. Port
forwarding (or another solution, such as a VPN that simulates a Local-Area
Network) is required.

Spectating is also supported, also through direct connection.

Support for more simultaneous players and other connection methods are currently
in the works.
